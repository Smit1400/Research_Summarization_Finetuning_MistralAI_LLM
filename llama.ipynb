It was the culmination of a multi-year effort to build a world-class chess machine. There were several versions of Deep Blue, with the first version, Deep Blue I, being based on a single-chip chess search engine. Deep Blue I played a match against Garry Kasparov in 1996, which Kasparov won. After analyzing the deficiencies of Deep Blue I, a series of changes were made to prepare for a rematch in 1997. This new version, Deep Blue II, featured a significantly enhanced chess chip with a redesigned evaluation function and other improvements. Deep Blue II defeated Garry Kasparov in the 1997 match, winning by a score of 3.5-2.5.\n",

      "\u001b[1;3;38;2;11;159;203m[text_summarizarion] A: Text summarization techniques have several advantages. Firstly, they allow for the generation of concise summaries that capture the main ideas of a document or article. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of text, as it enables users to quickly grasp the key points without having to read the entire document. Additionally, text summarization techniques can help in compressing the original document in a lossy manner, preserving the key concepts while reducing the overall length. This can be especially beneficial in scenarios where space is limited or when users are looking for a quick overview of the content. Furthermore, text summarization techniques can be applied to various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, speech recognition, and video captioning, enhancing the performance and accuracy of these systems. Overall, text summarization techniques offer a valuable tool for information retrieval and comprehension, saving time and effort for users.\n",

      "\u001b[1;3;38;2;90;149;237m[deep_blue] A: The Deep Blue computer chess system is a massively parallel system designed for carrying out chess game tree searches. It consists of a 30-node IBM RS/6000 SP computer and 480 single-chip chess search engines. The system is organized in three layers, with one node designated as the master and the rest as workers. The master searches the top levels of the chess game tree and distributes \"leaf\" positions to the workers for further examination. The workers carry out a few levels of additional search and then distribute their leaf positions to the chess chips, which search the last few levels of the tree. The overall system speed varies depending on the specific characteristics of the positions being searched, but it can search up to 330 million positions per second. The system relies on various techniques developed in earlier chess programs, such as quiescence search, iterative deepening, transposition tables, and NegaScout. The Deep Blue chess chips are capable of searching 2 to 2.5 million chess positions per second and communicate with their host node via a microchannel bus. The move generator in the Deep Blue chip is based on the Deep Thought move generator and is implemented as an 8x8 array of combinatorial logic.\n",
